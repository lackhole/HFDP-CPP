# Head First Design Patterns (C++)

This implements the examples in Eric Freeman, *Head First Design Patterns* to C++. 

There are at least 2 implementations.  
One tries to implements as similar as the book says(tried to use as many C++ style as possible though)   
The other implements using modern C++ idioms, most of them ignoring inheritances and interfaces.

Any feedback is welcomed!  

Most parts include tests, using CTest.  
You can run it with `-DRUN_TEST=ON` flags.  

## Requirements
  C++14 or higher
